Education Management System for Monitoring and Enhancing Academic Performance 
Problem statement :
Quality education is a cornerstone of sustainable development, yet many educational institutions lack efficient systems for tracking and managing student performance. Without proper tools, educators struggle to identify students who require additional support or qualify for scholarships, leading to missed opportunities for academic growth and equitable learning.

This project addresses the gap by creating a C++-based Education Management System that provides educators with the ability to manage student data, monitor grades and attendance, and promote scholarship programs to motivate students. The system directly supports Sustainable Development Goal 4: Quality Education by fostering data-driven decision-making and rewarding academic excellence.
